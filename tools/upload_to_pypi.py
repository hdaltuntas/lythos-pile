"""
Upload a Lythos Pile release to PyPI — works from an editor such as Thonny:
press the green Run button and answer the questions in the shell.

It does what `python -m build && twine upload dist/*` does on a terminal; the
difference is that it makes its own virtual environment to work from, so
nothing is installed into the system Python — on the distributions where pip
refuses to touch it (Arch, recent Debian / Ubuntu) that is the difference
between working and not.

What it does, in order:

    1. makes a small environment in ~/.lythos-release with build and twine in it
    2. rebuilds the distribution if you want it to (dist/ is cleaned first)
    3. compares the version in pyproject.toml with the version of the files
    4. checks whether that version is already published on PyPI
    5. runs `twine check` over the files
    6. finds the API token (see below), or asks for it in a small window
    7. shows what it is about to upload, asks you to confirm, then uploads

Nothing is sent anywhere before step 5, and any answer other than "yes" stops it.

PyPI accepts a version number once and never again. Read what steps 3 and 4
print before you confirm.

The token is looked for in this order:

    · the environment variable PYPI_TOKEN (or TWINE_PASSWORD)
    · ~/.pypirc, if an earlier run saved it there
    · otherwise a small window opens with a field to paste it into (Ctrl+V);
      what is pasted is shown as dots. Without a desktop the shell asks
      instead.

Editors such as Thonny and IDLE have no real console, and Python's hidden
input (getpass) waits there for a keyboard it never reads from — the program
looks frozen. That is why the token is asked for in a window, and never with
getpass outside a real terminal.

The token is not stored unless you say so, not printed and not logged; it is
passed to twine as an environment variable.
